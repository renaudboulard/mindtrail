# Session 1: Foundational Relaxation & Trail Senses

## Opening & Grounding

Welcome to MindTrail... your trail running mental training practice.

Find a comfortable position... sitting or lying down... whatever lets your body settle completely. Close your eyes... and take one deep breath in through your nose... hold it at the top for just a moment... and let it go slowly through your mouth.

Good.

Take another breath in... feeling your ribs expand... your belly rise... and release... letting your shoulders drop away from your ears. One more... breathe in, drawing in calm... and breathe out, releasing everything you carried into this room.

Now... let your breathing find its own natural rhythm. You do not need to control it. Just notice it — the way air moves in and out of you without any effort at all.

## Runner-Focused Body Scan

We are going to move through your body now... the same body that carries you up mountains and down valleys. We will start where every run begins — your feet.

Bring your attention to the soles of your feet... those two remarkable platforms that have absorbed thousands of miles of terrain. Feel the weight of them... the gentle pressure against whatever surface they rest on now. Notice your arches... your heels... the balls of your feet just behind your toes. Let any tension there soften... let your feet become heavy and warm.

Now move upward to your ankles... those intricate hinges of bone and ligament that adapt to every rock and root. Let them relax... letting go of any stiffness... any holding.

Feel your calves... those tireless engines of propulsion. Notice any tightness... and with your next exhale, allow that tightness to dissolve — like ice melting in sunlight. Your shins... your knees... let them soften.

Rise into your thighs... your quadriceps and hamstrings... the powerful muscles that drive you uphill and control you on descents. They have worked so hard for you. Give them permission now to be completely still... completely at ease.

Your hips and pelvis... the foundation of your running posture. Let them settle... heavy... grounded. Your lower back... often carrying tension you have forgotten about... breathe into that space and let it release.

Move up through your core... your abdominals and obliques that stabilize every single stride. Let your belly be soft now... rising and falling gently with each breath.

Your shoulders... runners carry so much tension here, especially in the final kilometers. Let your shoulders melt downward... away from your ears... like warm honey sliding off a spoon.

Your neck... your jaw... let your jaw hang slightly open, your tongue resting softly behind your lower teeth. Your face... the muscles around your eyes... your forehead. Smooth everything out — as if a gentle hand were pressing away every line of effort.

You are completely relaxed now... your whole body quiet and warm... a runner at perfect rest.

## Deepening — Building Your Trail Safe Space

Now... I want you to imagine a trail.

Not just any trail — your trail. A place that exists for you alone, somewhere in the mountains, where the world is exactly as it should be. We are going to build this place together, one sense at a time.

Start with what you see.

You are standing on a single-track trail... no wider than your shoulders... winding gently through a forest. The trees around you are tall — pine and fir, their trunks straight and steady, reaching high above you into a canopy that filters the sunlight into soft, shifting patterns on the ground. Dappled light... golden and green... moves slowly across the trail as a breeze stirs the branches overhead.

The trail surface is packed earth — firm but forgiving — scattered with a few small stones, a thin layer of pine needles in places. It curves ahead of you, disappearing around a gentle bend, inviting you forward. The light is warm. It is morning — mid-morning — and the angle of the sun paints everything in rich, saturated color.

Look around you... notice the shades of green. The dark, almost black green of the fir trees closest to you... the bright emerald of ferns growing along the trail edge... the pale, silvery green of lichen on a nearby boulder. The sky, where you glimpse it through gaps in the canopy, is a deep, clear blue.

Now... let the sounds arrive.

You hear birdsong first — not a chorus, but individual voices. A robin somewhere to your left, its melody bright and unhurried. A woodpecker tapping in the distance — that rhythmic, purposeful knock against bark. The breeze moves through the canopy above you with a sound like slow breathing... a soft, continuous whisper.

And beneath all of it — silence. The deep, grounding silence of a forest that has been here for hundreds of years. A silence that does not feel empty but full... full of presence... full of peace.

Now... feel.

Feel the temperature of the air on your skin — cool in the shade, warm where a shaft of sunlight reaches your forearms. Feel the ground beneath your feet through the soles of your trail shoes — that firm, slightly springy surface. A gentle breeze touches the back of your neck... just enough to notice, just enough to feel alive.

And smell.

Breathe in deeply through your nose... and there it is — pine resin. That clean, sharp, almost sweet scent of the forest. Beneath it, the rich, loamy smell of damp earth... soil that has been softened by recent rain. There is something green in that smell too... the scent of growing things, of ferns unfurling, of moss drinking moisture from the air.

You can almost taste it — that freshness at the back of your throat when you breathe the mountain air... clean and cool... the taste of altitude... of being far from roads, far from noise, far from anything that is not this trail and this moment.

This is your place. It is real because your mind has made it real. Every detail you notice strengthens it.

## Core Visualization — Your First Gentle Run

Now... you begin to move.

You start running — slowly, gently, the way you begin every run when the day feels generous and there is no watch on your wrist. Your footsteps are soft on the packed earth... a quiet, rhythmic contact... left, right, left, right. Each foot landing lightly, naturally, beneath your center.

The trail tilts upward... a gradual climb, nothing steep, just enough to feel your breath deepen and your legs engage. You lean slightly forward into the hill... your arms swing easily at your sides... and your cadence shortens just a touch, naturally adapting. You feel your calves activate... your glutes begin to work... and your breathing finds a rhythm — in for three steps... out for three steps... in for three... out for three.

The trees thin slightly as you climb, and more sunlight reaches the trail. You feel its warmth on your shoulders... on your face. A bird takes flight from a low branch just ahead of you — a flash of movement, a quick flutter of wings — and then silence again, except for your breathing and your footsteps.

You crest the rise... and the trail levels out, curving gently to the right alongside a small mountain stream. You can hear it before you see it — the bright, tumbling sound of water moving over stones. And then there it is, to your left, maybe three meters away... clear water catching the light, flowing steadily downhill over a bed of smooth, grey and brown rocks.

Your stride lengthens now on the flat ground. Your body finds its rhythm... that effortless pace where movement feels automatic, where your legs carry you forward without conscious instruction. The trail is smooth here — packed earth, a carpet of fine pine needles — and every footfall is cushioned and quiet.

You run alongside the stream for a while... matching its pace... listening to the water's constant, reassuring voice. The air is cooler here, near the water, and you feel that coolness on your skin like a gift.

The trail begins to descend... gently... a soft downhill gradient that feels like the mountain is helping you. You let gravity carry some of your weight... your stride opens up... your feet land with a little less effort. There is a looseness in your body now — your hips are open, your shoulders are low, your hands are relaxed. You feel light... as if the trail is a ribbon and you are gliding along it.

This is flow.

This is what it feels like when every part of you — body, mind, breath — is aligned in one direction, one purpose, one movement. There is no thinking here. There is only running... only trail... only the present moment unfolding beneath your feet, step after step after step.

## Integration & Closing

Slowly now... let the trail begin to fade. The colors soften... the sounds grow quieter... the sensation of movement gently stills. You are no longer running — you are standing... and then you are sitting... and then you are here, in this room, in this chair, in this moment.

But the feeling remains.

That feeling of flow... of ease... of your body moving in perfect harmony with the trail beneath it — that feeling lives inside you now. It is not something you have to chase. It is something you have built, right here, with nothing but your mind and your breath.

This feeling of flow — remember it. You can return here anytime.

Whenever you need it — before a race, during a hard training block, on a rest day when your legs are tired but your spirit needs the trail — close your eyes, take three slow breaths, and come back to this forest. The trail will be here. The sunlight will be here. The stream will be waiting.

Take one more deep breath in... hold it... and release.

Begin to feel the room around you... the weight of your body in the chair or on the floor. Wiggle your fingers... your toes. When you are ready... open your eyes.

Welcome back, runner.

Your trail is waiting for you — in the mountains and in your mind. Both are real. Both will make you stronger.

# Bonus: Race Week Quick Protocol

## Opening

Close your eyes.

...

Take a breath. Not a hurried breath. A slow, full, deliberate breath — in through your nose... hold it for a moment... and release it through your mouth.

...

Again. In... letting your lungs expand completely... hold... and out — feeling your whole body settle downward.

...

One more. In... and release everything.

...

Good.

Tomorrow, you race.

And tonight, you do not need a long session. You do not need new techniques or strategies or mental frameworks. You have built all of those over the past seven sessions. Tonight is not about building. Tonight is about remembering.

We are going to move through each session — quickly, like turning the pages of a book you know by heart — and we are going to activate the anchors you have already installed. Think of this as a systems check. Every tool, confirmed. Every anchor, refreshed. Every part of you — ready.

This will take eight minutes. When we are done, you will sleep with the quiet confidence of someone who has already run this race in their mind.

...

## Quick Body Scan

Let's begin with your body. A brief scan — not a deep exploration, just a check-in.

...

Start at your feet. Feel them. These are the instruments that will carry you tomorrow — over rock, over root, over mud and gravel and packed earth. They are rested. They are ready. Let any tension there soften.

...

Your legs — calves, quads, hamstrings, glutes. The engines of forward motion. Feel them heavy and warm, full of stored energy. They have done the training. The miles are in the bank. There is nothing more to add. Just rest.

...

Your core and back. The stabilizers that hold everything together on uneven ground and steep climbs. Quiet and strong.

...

Your shoulders and arms. Relaxed. Loose. Low. They will swing freely tomorrow, helping you balance on descents, pumping gently on the climbs. For now — still.

...

Your face. Jaw unclenched. Forehead smooth. Eyes closed and soft.

...

One breath to seal the scan. In... hold... and release.

Your body is ready.

...

## Anchor Recall — Session One

Now we go back. To the beginning.

...

Session One. Your trail safe space. Remember it. The single-track winding through the forest. The tall pines. The dappled sunlight on packed earth. The sound of birdsong and the whisper of wind through the canopy.

...

Feel it for a moment. The temperature of the air. The springy surface beneath your feet. The smell of pine resin and damp earth.

And the feeling — flow. That effortless movement where body and mind and trail become one thing, one rhythm, one forward motion.

...

You built this place. It lives inside you. Tomorrow, whenever you need a moment of calm — between the chaos of aid stations or the intensity of a climb — you can close your eyes for three seconds and return here. The trail will be waiting. It always is.

...

## Anchor Recall — Session Two

Session Two. Technical descents.

...

See the rocky trail dropping away below you. Feel the precision of your feet reading the ground — rock, root gap, packed earth, embedded stone. Feel your eyes scanning ahead, your body flowing downward, your balance automatic and sure.

And the anchor — say it now:

"Your feet know what to do. Trust them."

...

They do. They have run a thousand descents. They will run tomorrow's with the same intelligence, the same adaptability, the same quiet precision. Your job is to look ahead and stay balanced. Your feet will handle the rest.

...

## Anchor Recall — Session Three

Session Three. Climbing.

...

Feel the rhythm. In for three steps, out for three steps. The short, economic cadence. The word — strong — placed gently into the breath pattern.

See the switchbacks above you. Not all of them. Just the next one. That is your universe. Chunk the climb. Turn to turn. Each one achievable. Each one complete.

And when the burn comes — and it will — the willingness framework.

"I am willing to feel this."

...

And the anchor:

"I am a climber. I welcome the vertical."

...

Tomorrow, when the trail tilts upward — and it will tilt upward many times — you will not dread it. You will lean into it. You will breathe into it. You are a climber. The mountain knows.

...

## Anchor Recall — Session Four

Session Four. Night running.

...

See the cone of your headlamp on the trail. Three meters of perfect clarity. Your ears painting the forest in sound — footfalls, wind, water. The reduced world of the night, where distractions vanish and focus sharpens.

Remember the stars. The moment you switched off your headlamp and the sky exploded above you. The gratitude. The awe.

And the phrases:

"I am on the trail. I have my light. I am safe."

...

And the anchor:

"Darkness is my element."

...

If your race enters the night — and it may — you will be ready. The dark is not a threat. It is a familiar room. You know exactly how to move through it.

...

## Anchor Recall — Session Five

Session Five. Aid stations.

...

See yourself walking into a checkpoint. Calm. Purposeful. No hesitation.

Four steps. Ninety seconds. Refill — food — feet check — leave.

The smooth stop. In and out. Every second purposeful.

And when the chair looks inviting and the warmth pulls at you:

"Clear mind. What do I need?"

...

The anchor:

"An aid station is a gas station, not a hotel."

...

You pull in. You refuel. You pull out. You keep moving. That discipline alone is worth thirty minutes over the course of a hundred kilometers. Thirty minutes that other runners lose to hesitation, to comfort, to sitting down and struggling to stand up again.

You will not be one of them.

...

## Anchor Recall — Session Six

Session Six. The hardest session. The most important one.

...

Remember the crisis point. Kilometer seventy-eight. Two AM. The cold, the fatigue, the nausea. The whisper — "You could stop."

And what you did. The deliberate breath. The three questions.

Am I injured — no.
Is it dangerous — no.
Have I fueled — no, and that is the problem.

The solution. Fuel. Warmth. Purpose. Recovery. Walking first, then shuffling, then running again.

And the anchor — the one that matters most:

"I do not stop. I solve problems, and I keep moving."

...

Say it once more. Let it settle into your bones.

"I do not stop. I solve problems... and I keep moving."

...

Tomorrow, if the whisper comes — and it may — you will recognize it. You will not be surprised. You will not be overwhelmed. You will breathe. You will ask the questions. You will solve the problem. And you will keep moving.

Because that is who you are.

...

## Anchor Recall — Session Seven

Session Seven. The full race.

...

See the highlights now — a rapid sequence, like a film reel.

The start line. The horn. The surge of runners in the dark.

The first climb. Strong. Switchback to switchback.

The technical descent. Feet reading the ground. Flow.

The crisis. Clear mind. Three questions. Recovery.

The night section. Headlamp on. Stars above. Darkness as an ally.

The final kilometer. Town lights. Your name on the loudspeaker.

The finish line. The medal. The tears you did not expect.

...

You have already run this race. In your mind. In full. From the four AM alarm to the medal around your neck. The neural pathways are laid. The emotional rehearsal is complete. Tomorrow is not the first time. Tomorrow is the performance of something you have already practiced.

...

## Final Confidence Activation

Now — bring everything together. All seven sessions. All the anchors. All the tools. Feel them stacked inside you like layers of armor — not heavy, not rigid, but strong and flexible and ready.

...

Your trail safe space — always accessible.
Your feet — intelligent, trustworthy, precise.
Your climbing system — breath, word, chunk, willingness.
Your night confidence — ears, light, safety, stars.
Your aid station discipline — in, execute, out.
Your crisis framework — breathe, three questions, solve, move.
Your race rehearsal — start to finish, already complete.

...

You are not hoping you are ready. You know you are ready. The training is done — both physical and mental. There is nothing left to add, nothing left to improve, nothing left to worry about. The hay is in the barn. The work is finished.

All that remains is to show up tomorrow and do what you have already done.

...

Say this now. Let it be the last thing you hear before you sleep:

"You are ready. You have done this before — in your mind."

...

Again. Quieter. Closer.

"You are ready. You have done this before — in your mind."

...

## Closing

Take a deep breath in... the deepest of the night... hold it — hold all seven sessions, hold every kilometer, hold the finish line — and release.

...

One more. In... and out. Letting your body settle completely into rest.

...

Your breathing will carry you into sleep now. Let it. Do not hold onto anything — not the excitement, not the nerves, not the race plan. Let it all go. Your subconscious will keep working while you sleep, consolidating the pathways, reinforcing the anchors, preparing you in ways your conscious mind cannot.

...

Tomorrow morning, when that alarm sounds, you will wake up sharp and calm. You will put on your race kit. You will pin your bib. You will walk to the start line. And you will know — with a certainty that comes from deep preparation — that you have every tool you need.

...

Sleep well, runner.

You are ready.

...

End of Bonus Session.

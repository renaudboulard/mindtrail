# Session 5: Aid Station Transitions & Fueling

You are here... and that means you are building something powerful.

Over the past four sessions, you have trained your mind to find calm on the trail, to trust your feet on technical terrain, to welcome steep climbs, and to own the darkness. Today, we turn to a skill that separates experienced ultra runners from everyone else — the ability to move through aid stations with discipline, clarity, and purpose.

An aid station can save your race. It can also end it — not because of injury, but because of hesitation. Because of sitting down. Because of losing five minutes that become ten, that become twenty, that become a DNF.

Today, you will rehearse efficient stops. You will build fueling discipline that runs on autopilot. And you will learn to leave an aid station even when every part of you wants to stay.

Let's begin.

...

Close your eyes. Take a slow breath in through your nose... hold it for a moment at the top... and release it through your mouth.

Again. In through the nose... hold... and out.

One more. Deep and steady... hold... and let it all go.

...

## Clear Mind Technique

Now — before we step into the visualization — I want to give you a tool for making decisions under fatigue.

At kilometer sixty-five of a hundred-kilometer race, your prefrontal cortex — the part of your brain responsible for planning and decision-making — is operating at reduced capacity. Fatigue clouds judgment. Emotions amplify. Simple choices feel overwhelming.

So we simplify.

Here is the technique. When you arrive at an aid station and your mind feels scattered, you do this — you take one deliberate breath... and you say to yourself: "Clear mind. What do I need?"

Not what do I want. Not what sounds good. What do I need.

...

Try it now. Imagine you have been running for nine hours. Your thoughts are foggy. You walk into a bustling checkpoint with volunteers calling out to you, music playing, the smell of soup and coffee drifting toward you.

Take one breath...

"Clear mind. What do I need?"

...

Feel how that single question cuts through the noise. It is a reset button. It pulls you out of emotional decision-making and into functional, purposeful action.

Good. Hold onto that.

...

## The Smooth Stop — Four Steps, Ninety Seconds

Now let's build your default aid station routine. This is the smooth stop — the one you will execute at every checkpoint where nothing has gone wrong. Four steps. Ninety seconds. In and out.

...

Picture this. You are approaching an aid station at kilometer forty. You have been running for about six hours. You feel tired but functional. Your pace is steady. You can see the canopy ahead — the orange cones, the tables lined with cups and food, volunteers in bright vests.

As you approach, you are already thinking ahead. You do not wait until you arrive to figure out what you need. You decided this during the last kilometer.

...

Step one — refill.

You unclip your soft flask from your vest as you walk in. You hand it to a volunteer or you move to the water station. You say clearly: "Water, please" — or "Electrolyte mix." No hesitation. No browsing. You know what goes in your bottles because you planned it before the race.

Feel the cool liquid filling the flask. Hear the splash as it reaches the top. You clip it back into your vest.

...

Step two — food.

You reach for what you planned to eat. A piece of banana. A handful of salted potatoes. A gel from your drop bag. You eat it now — standing — or you put it in your pocket for the next kilometer. You do not stand at the table sampling options. You are not at a buffet. You are refueling a machine.

Feel the texture of the food in your mouth. Taste the salt. Chew deliberately. Swallow.

...

Step three — feet check.

A quick glance down. Anything in your shoe? A pebble, a hot spot forming? If yes, you take fifteen seconds to fix it — shake the shoe, adjust the sock, apply a piece of tape from your kit. If no — and most of the time the answer is no — you move on.

...

Step four — leave.

This is the most important step. You turn your body toward the trail exit. You start walking. Within three strides, you are moving away from the aid station. You do not sit down. You do not chat. You do not "just rest for a minute."

You leave.

...

Let's run through it again, faster now.

You walk in — flask out — refill — clip it back — grab food — eat or pocket — glance at feet — turn — and go.

Ninety seconds. That is it.

Feel how clean that is. Feel how controlled. You arrived with a plan, you executed it, and you left. No wasted time. No wasted energy debating.

...

Now let's practice this three times in quick succession. Different aid stations, same routine.

Kilometer twenty-five. Small checkpoint. One table. You walk in... refill... grab a banana... feet are fine... you leave. Smooth.

...

Kilometer fifty. Bigger station. Drop bags. More noise. You find your bag... swap your headlamp batteries... refill both flasks... eat a sandwich quarter you packed... feet check — a small hot spot on the left heel, you apply tape from your kit... and you leave. Maybe two minutes this time because of the drop bag, but every second was purposeful.

...

Kilometer seventy-five. You are deep in the race now. Fatigue is heavy. The chairs look inviting. The soup smells incredible. But you take that breath — "Clear mind. What do I need?" — refill... gel... feet are fine... and you turn and go.

Good. That discipline will carry you.

...

## The Crisis Stop — Kilometer Sixty-Five

Now we go somewhere harder.

...

You are at kilometer sixty-five. The last ten kilometers have been rough. A long exposed ridge with wind. Your stomach has been turning for the past hour. You took a gel at kilometer sixty and it came back up. The taste of bile sits in the back of your throat.

You walk into the aid station — and this time, it feels different. The warmth hits you. Somebody offers you a chair. You can hear other runners talking about dropping. The word "abandon" floats in the air.

...

Feel this moment fully. Your legs are stiff. Your quads ache with every step. Your feet are swollen inside your shoes. The nausea rises in waves — not constant, but persistent. Your headlamp is starting to dim. You are cold.

And that thought arrives — soft, reasonable, seductive: "I could stop here. I could sit down. I could be warm. I could be done."

...

This is the moment. This is where races are decided.

So you breathe. One deliberate breath. "Clear mind."

And you ask three questions.

...

Question one — am I injured?

Not sore. Not tired. Not uncomfortable. Injured. Is something broken? Is something torn? Am I bleeding in a way that will not stop? Am I risking permanent damage by continuing?

You scan your body. Quads — sore, but functional. Feet — blistered, but you can walk. Stomach — nauseous, but not dangerously ill.

The answer is no. You are not injured.

...

Question two — is it dangerous to continue?

Is there a storm that could become life-threatening? Is the trail ahead exposed in a way that risks hypothermia? Are you so disoriented that you could get lost?

You check. The weather is cold but stable. The next section is forested — sheltered. You know the route.

The answer is no. It is not dangerous.

...

Question three — have I fueled?

This is the one people forget. So much of what feels like a physical crisis at kilometer sixty-five is actually a fueling crisis. When did you last eat something that stayed down? When did you last drink? Low blood sugar and dehydration mimic despair. They make everything feel hopeless.

You think back. The gel came up. Before that — you had a few sips of electrolyte at the last checkpoint, but you have not absorbed solid food in nearly two hours.

The answer is no. You have not fueled properly.

...

So here is the diagnosis — you have a mental and fueling problem, not a race-ending problem. And mental and fueling problems have solutions.

...

Here is what you do. You stand. You do not sit down — because sitting down is how races end. You stand, and you ask the volunteer for flat cola and a small piece of bread. Something your stomach can handle. You sip the cola slowly. You feel the sugar enter your system. You take small bites of the bread. You breathe between each one.

...

The nausea does not vanish instantly. But it stabilizes. The sugar from the cola hits your bloodstream within minutes. Your mind begins to clear.

And now — you leave.

You do not run. You walk. You walk out of the aid station and onto the trail. One step at a time. You keep sipping. You keep breathing.

...

After five minutes of walking, the nausea has eased. After ten minutes, you try a shuffle — a slow, gentle jog. Your legs protest, but they respond. After fifteen minutes, you are running again. Not fast. Not pretty. But running.

You are back in your race.

...

## Fueling Rehearsal — The Timer System

Now let's build the habit that prevents crisis stops in the first place.

...

Picture yourself back at the start of a long training run. You set a timer on your watch — every thirty minutes, it beeps.

When the timer goes off, you eat. Period. No negotiation. No "I'll eat at the next flat section." No "I don't feel hungry yet."

The timer beeps. You eat.

...

Feel this. You are running a long climb. The timer beeps. You do not want to eat — your breathing is heavy, the gel sounds unappealing. But you reach into your vest, pull out the gel, tear the top, and take it down in two squeezes. You chase it with water.

It takes twelve seconds. Then it is done.

...

This is the discipline of fueling — it is not about desire, it is about execution. Your body needs two hundred to three hundred calories per hour during an ultra. That is non-negotiable. Whether you feel like eating is irrelevant. You eat because the version of you at kilometer eighty needs those calories.

...

Now — what about when the stomach rebels? Because it will. At some point in a long race, nausea will visit.

Here is your protocol.

When nausea arrives, you do not stop eating entirely. You shift what you eat. Move from gels to real food — a piece of banana, some salted potato, a small piece of bread. Reduce the volume but maintain the frequency. Sip rather than gulp. Walk while you eat if you need to.

...

Feel yourself executing this. Kilometer fifty-five. Your stomach is uneasy. The timer beeps. You reach for a gel — and your body says no. So instead, you pull out a small rice ball from your vest pocket. You take a bite. Chew slowly. Swallow. Wait. Another bite. The rice settles. It stays down.

You have just solved a problem without stopping.

...

And if it comes back up — you wait ten minutes and try again. Smaller. Simpler. Sips of cola. A single cracker. You keep trying because giving up on fuel means giving up on the race — just slower.

...

## Integration

Let's bring it all together now.

...

See yourself moving through an entire race — checkpoint to checkpoint — with this system running in the background like software.

The timer beeps. You eat. No thought required.

You approach an aid station. Four steps. Ninety seconds. In and out.

A crisis arrives. You breathe. Three questions. Solve the problem. Leave.

...

This is not willpower. This is preparation. You are not tougher than the runners who sit down and cannot get back up. You are more prepared. You have rehearsed this. You have seen it in your mind. When the moment comes, your body will know what to do because your mind has already done it.

...

Let me leave you with this anchor. Say it to yourself now:

"An aid station is a gas station, not a hotel."

...

Again.

"An aid station is a gas station, not a hotel."

...

You pull in. You refuel. You pull out. You keep driving.

That is your system. That is your discipline. That is how you finish.

...

Take one more deep breath in... hold it... and release.

...

When you are ready, open your eyes. You are sharper now. You are more prepared. And next time you walk into a checkpoint — in training or on race day — your body will remember this.

You know what to do.

...

End of Session Five.
